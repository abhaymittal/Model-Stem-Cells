@article{Watt2000,
abstract = {Stem cells are currently in the news for two reasons: the successful cultivation of human embryonic stem cell lines and reports that adult stem cells can differentiate into developmentally unrelated cell types, such as nerve cells into blood cells. Both intrinsic and extrinsic signals regulate stem cell fate and some of these signals have now been identified. Certain aspects of the stem cell microenvironment, or niche, are conserved between tissues, and this can be exploited in the application of stem cells to tissue replacement therapy.},

@article{Kauffman1969,
abstract = {Proto-organisms probably were randomly aggregated nets of chemical reactions. The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly con- structed nets of these binary “genes”. The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested.},

@article{Veliz-Cuba2011,
abstract = {Boolean networks have been successfully used in modelling gene regulatory networks. However, for large networks, analysis by simulation becomes unfeasible. In this paper we propose a reduction method for Boolean networks that decreases the size of the network, while preserving important dynamical properties and topological features. As a result, the reduced network can be used to infer properties about the original network and to gain a better understanding of the role of network topology on the dynamics. In particular, we use the reduction method to study steady states of Boolean networks and apply our results to models of Th-lymphocyte differentiation and the lac operon.},

@article{Greil2012,
abstract = {In a network, the components of a given system are represented as nodes, the interactions are abstracted as links between the nodes. Boolean networks refer to a class of dynamics on networks, in fact it is the simplest possible dynamics where each node has a value 0 or 1. This allows to investigate extensively the dynamics both analytically and by numerical experiments. The present article focuses on the theoretical concept of relevant components and their immediate application in plant biology. References for more in-depth treatment of the mathematical details are also given.},
